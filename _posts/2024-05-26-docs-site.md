# Jekyll - The Static Site Generator

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that transforms your plain text into beautiful static web sites and blogs.It can be use for a documentation site, a blog, an event site, or really any web site you like. It’s fast, secure, easy, and open source.

Let installing and configuring Jekyll using the Chirpy theme.We configure the site, create some pages with markdown, automatically build it with a GitHub action and even host it for FREE on GitHub pages.If you don’t want to host in the cloud, I show how to host it on your own server or even in Docker.

# Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git

```
To avoid installing RubyGems packages as the root user:
If you are using bash (usually the default for most)
```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

```

If you are using zsh 
```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

```

Make sure Ruby is >= 3.1.1
